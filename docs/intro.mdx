# Welcome

For me... "quickstart" tutorials that install everything by script or have a dense string of imcomprehensible code blocks to copy/paste are frustrating.

I felt helpless when something inevitably failed because I had no idea what I built. Attempts to fix things made it worse and eventually I would delete the whole project pretending I never wanted to understand that topic anyway.

On the other hand- I don't have weeks to study topics that aren't part of my current IT role. Plus I get bored entirely too easily and YouTube eerily knows what "recommended videos" to sneak into _up next_ queue.

If you are looking for something in-between, I hope this tutorial series will split the extremes and give you something usable long term. LFG!
