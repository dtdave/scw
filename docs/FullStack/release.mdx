## The story so far

The organization is implementing a fraud detection service.

- Large transactions are targets for fraud.
- The fraud service will check those transactions for address and account owner details prior to posting them.
- Users should receive a transaction error message when fraud is detected.

As developers:

- we've confirmed the solution works on our dev laptops.
- We've staged the change as a feature flag in the application's main API.
- At 4:50PM Friday we put on our jackets, enable the flag, and start a week long beach vacation.

## Enable the service

First check the feature flag status:

1. Obtain the application URL either from Pepper, or be running

```bash
kubectl get svc -n dbic
```

2. Paste the URL into your browser while changing the ending to look like:

```bash
/api/api/features
```

3. Confirm the current status for all flags is "false".
4. Enable the feature flag with the enable endpoint:

```bash
/api/api/features/enable/fraud_service
```

5. To confirm everything is working, go into banking, transfer & pay, and confirm at $5 payment works.
