## The story so far

The organization is implementing a fraud detection service.

- Large transactions are targets for fraud.
- The fraud service will check those transactions prior to posting them.
- Users should receive a negative response when fraud is detected.

As developers:

- we've confirmed the solution works on our dev laptops.
- We've staged the change as a feature flag in the application's main API.
- At 4:50PM Friday we put on our jackets and enable the flag on the way out the door.

## Enable the service

First check the feature flag status:

1. Obtain the application URL either from Pepper, or be running

```bash
kubectl get svc -n dbic
```

2. Paste the URL into your browser while changing the ending to look like:

```bash
/api/api/features
```

3. You should see the feature flags and enabled status of "false".
4. Enable the feature flag by setting the

```bash
/api/api/features/enable/fraud_service
```
