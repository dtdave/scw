## Environment setup

We'll spin up a Dynatrace tenant and build an application together from scratch.

### A) Dynatrace tenant setup

1. Launch the [Dyantrace trial](https://www.dynatrace.com/trial/) page.
2. Enter an email address and "Start free trial".
3. Follow the prompts.
4. Check email (junk/spam folders!) for a "Welcome" message.

### B) Cloud setup

1. Dynatrace works across all clouds. Follow the instructor prompts to connect.
2. Once logged in follow check out the section below matching your provider.

#### AWS

1. In the top right bar, confirm the region is Ohio. If not, click the region and select "US EAST (OHIO)"

2. You have full access to the various features of AWS. You could search for "Elastic Kubernetes Service" or "EC2". Aside from a Cloudformation VPC, you shouldn't see anything today as we'll build it all together.
3. in the top bar, open an AWS cloud shell session by clicking the shell icon.

### C) Setup

We'll use [Pepper](/docs/pepper) today. It's a cloud-agnostic deployment assistant built to help setup applications while providing every step along the way. (No magic whooosh and done!)

1. In your cloud shell, download Pepper.

```bash
curl https://www.suchcodewow.io/manifests/pepper.ps1 > ~/pepper.ps1
```

2. Start Pepper with the `-c` option to show commands as they run so you could use them manually later, and `-n` option to specify the existing VPC.

```bash
pwsh ./pepper.ps1 -c -n scw-AWSstack
```

:::info
Pepper will generate a running checklist of deployment items. Anything showing `[-]` is information, while anything with `[>]` shows the exact command you could run yourself with everything filled it.
