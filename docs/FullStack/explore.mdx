In this section we'll look at the front to back visibility provided by Dynatrace immediately after deployment.

## Smartscape

1. In your Dynatrace tenant, select the "Smartscape" option from the menu. You'll see that Dynatrace has already generated a topology view.

2. By clicking on any of the selected components Dynatrace shows the vertical relationships for that entity.

## Services View

1. Select "Services" on the left menu. Dynatrace shows all detected services and key metrics for each.
2. Select the "OrdersAPI" service to see a dashboard and further drilldowns for it:

- The top left block shows what calls this service, what this service depends on, and where it's running
- Bottom left shows service KPI's like failure rate & throughput
- Dynatrace always keeps everything connected. The right side shows ways to view the service flow, back up the chain, and individual traces

## Databases View

1. Select "Databases" on the left menu, then "dbic". Similar to services, Dynatrace constantly tracks service dependencies, and underlying infrastructure at all times.
2. Database calls from any source are shown here with the ability to reverse back up the chain with the "view backtrace" button.

## Logs
