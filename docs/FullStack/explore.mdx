In this section we'll look at the front to back visibility provided by Dynatrace immediately after deployment.

We'll also share a few highlights of user-configurable options available. (Any could be automated)

## Smartscape

1. In your Dynatrace tenant, select the "Smartscape" option from the menu. You'll see that Dynatrace has already generated a topology view.

2. By clicking on any of the selected components Dynatrace shows the vertical relationships for that entity.

3. This real-time visibility is great when planning to move an application; All dependencies are clearly visible.

## Services View

![services](/img/explore3.jpg)

1. Select "Services" on the left menu. Dynatrace shows all detected services and key metrics for each.
2. Select the "mainapi" service (Flask app) to see a dashboard and further drilldowns for it:

- The top left block shows what calls this service, what this service depends on, and where it's running
- Bottom left shows service KPI's like failure rate & throughput
- Dynatrace always keeps everything connected. The right side shows ways to view the service flow, back up the chain, and individual traces

## Databases View

![services](/img/explore4.jpg)

1. Select "Databases" on the left menu, then "dbic". Similar to services, Dynatrace constantly tracks service dependencies, and underlying infrastructure at all times.
2. Database calls from any source are shown here with the ability to reverse back up the chain with the "view backtrace" button.

## Logs

1. In Settings -> Log Monitoring -> Log sources and storage, check the box for the host to enable log integration.

2. Select "Logs" on the left menu.
3. Select from log types, messages, and sources in "available attributes".

## Application View

![services](/img/explore6.jpg)

1. Select "Frontend" on the left menu (under "Applications & Microservices")
2. Select "My Web Application"

:::tip
It's easy to split applications into their own views. It's done by selecting the "..." in the applications view and "editing detection settings"
:::

3. Add XHR request support for added visibility.
4. Edit the application from the "..." button top right, then select "enablement and cost control" on the inner menu.
5. Enable Session Replay.
6. (Optional!) In the "Data Privacy" -> "Session Replay" section, select the "Recording" and then "Block List." Do the same for "Playback".

:::tip
Dynatrace offers granular control at the point of capture for security and privacy. Your organization's needs might be open, closed, or a very unique combination. For today's session, it's often more interesting to allow more visibility to see replay capabilities in realtime.
