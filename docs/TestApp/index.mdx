# 3- First Application

In just a few steps, we can deploy a simple application on your kubernetes platform. This simple application is a great way to make sure your environment is working well and demonstrates key commands we'll use later when deploying more complex scenarios.

## Deploy the application

kubectl create deployment demo --image=httpd --port=80

kubectl expose deployment demo

kubectl create ingress demo-localhost --class=nginx --rule="demo.192.168.1.206.nip.io/\_=demo:80"
