# app install steps

:::tip More Help Available!

If you run into unfamiliar concepts on this page, check out the [previous page](./) for key concepts.

:::

## Deploy the Demo app

Create a demo namespace.

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
```

Deploy the apache httpd server.

```bash
kubectl create deployment demo --image=httpd --port=80 -n demo
```

- `demo` is the name of our deployment. Feel free to use your favorite's pet name here instead. Just remember you rebelled slightly for other commands that reference SirFluffyRoyalToeBeans.
- `--image` tells kubectl we want to use the [httpd docker image :arrow_upper_right:](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd).
- `--port=80` tell kubectl which port it should run on.

## :checkered_flag: Checkpoint

You can check on what you've deployed and the status of each deployment with:

```bash
kubectl get deploy -A
```

While that shows what you've deployed (blueprints), you can see all running pods (the entities actually doing work) with:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

You should see your hard working demo pod running right next to the other kubernetes components.

```bash
NAMESPACE       NAME                                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system     coredns-96cc4f57d-52nqb                    1/1     Running     0          46m
kube-system     local-path-provisioner-84bb864455-8hpzb    1/1     Running     0          46m

ingress-nginx   ingress-nginx-controller-cb87575f5-xsm7l   1/1     Running     0          42m
//highlight-next-line
demo            demo-654c477f6d-r9558                      1/1     Running     0          12m
```

:::tip

Remember kubectl is tricksy sometimes. If you don't specify `-A` or another namespace kubectl returns only the _default_ namespace. It can be a bit scary to think all of your work evaporated.

## Expose the App

The application is running in our kubernetes cluster but currently has no way to communicate with other pods. We need to expose it with:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment demo
```

It's now running as a usuable service within the cluster. You can see what's open for internal communication with:

```bash
kubectl get svc -A
```

You'll see demo appears in the list of available services.

```bash
NAMESPACE       NAME                                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
default         kubernetes                           ClusterIP      10.43.0.1       <none>          443/TCP                      55m
kube-system     kube-dns                             ClusterIP      10.43.0.10      <none>          53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP       55m
kube-system     metrics-server                       ClusterIP      10.43.241.125   <none>          443/TCP                      55m
ingress-nginx   ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP      10.43.234.221   <none>          443/TCP                      51m
ingress-nginx   ingress-nginx-controller             LoadBalancer   10.43.112.5     192.168.1.232   80:32611/TCP,443:30961/TCP   51m
//highlight-next-line
demo            demo                                 ClusterIP      10.43.122.111   <none>          80/TCP                       16s
```

In the above example (your setup might use a different IP range), the pods are running on the 10.43.x.x network. Demo is now happily ready to serve internal requests on http://10.43.122.111:80.

However, that IP address range is internal only. We can't get there directly.

The final step to create an ingress with nginx. Nginx sends external requests to the right internal service.

:::info

This step requires a bit of modification. The code below shows the command you'd run for the IP address listed above for the nginx LoadBalancer. You need to update it to the IP address of **your** host.

:::

```bash
kubectl create ingress demo --class=nginx --rule="demo.192.168.1.232.nip.io/*=demo:80" -n demo
```

- `--class=nginx` tells kubectl what type of ingress to create. The nginx controller automatically configures any new ingress with this type.
- `--rule-"demo...` does two things. It **A)** It creates a URL for us to access our web service. Nip.io is a neat utility that lets us use subdomains (like demo) in front of any IP address. It's just a simple way to access different services from the single IP address of our host. **B)** The second part sends all requests for that URL to our web service (demo on port 80).
- `-n demo` is important! The ingress needs to be in the same namespace as the target service so nginx can find it.

## :checkered_flag: Checkpoint

If successful, you'll reach a simple page saying "It works!" when you connect to your URL.
