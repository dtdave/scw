## Intro

### Log in to AWS

In this section we'll setup your AWS tenant using a small helper script.

Once you log in to AWS, open a cloud shell.

If you see a splash screen, close it with the "close" button.

After closing the pop-up window, you should see a command prompt similar to this.

### Get the helper script

Run the command below to get the helper script.

```bash
need script here
```

[todo]
The above is the old script for reference. We need to fix and upload the BASH helper script here.

### Run the helper script

1. install eksctl
2. install kubernetes cluster

Next, we'll install the Dynatrace operator.
