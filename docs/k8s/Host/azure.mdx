title: Setup Azure VM

:::info Prerequisites
You'll need to have rights to create and modify virtual machines.
:::

## Login to Azure Portal

Click [here](https://portal.azure.com/#cloudshell) to login to Azure and open a cloud shell.

**Either:** select "Powershell" as the terminal type **-or-** ensure Powershell is selected at the top of the terminal window.

Switch into your cloud drive so anything you download and run will persist from session to session.

```bash
cd ~/clouddrive
```

## Download the helper script

This script lets you pick a subscription, creates a unique resource group for you (critical if others running this tutorial in the same subscription), and provides common commands.

Download the helper script:

```bash
curl https://www.suchcodewow.io/manifests/helper.ps1 > ~/clouddrive/helper.ps1
```

## Create the virtual machine

:::warning Check your subscription!
Your shell is connected to a subscription. When you create resources (groups/vm's/etc) in Azure, by default, they will be created in your current subscription.

Ensure that you are connected to the correct subscription using the helper script below.

:::

Run the helper script to setup your resource group and add a vm to it.

```bash
~/clouddrive/helper.ps1
```

The (name) below comes from the email address of your Azure account up to the '@' symbol. i.e. bob.smith@mail.com would be 'bob.smith'.

The script:

1. allows you to select a subscription (and set it as default).
1. creates a resource group in the format: scw-group-(name).
1. creates a vm in that resource group with the format: scw-host-(name).
1. saves the public IP of your vm into the _myip_ file.

:::tip Showing the commands
By default, the helper script shows each command as it runs so you can see what it is doing. This behavior could be changed by opening the script and changing `$show_commands = $true` to `$show_commands = $false` near the top.
:::

Details on the command used to create the vm are below.

- We're using the long term support (LTS) version of Ubuntu linux for the **image**.
- The **- - size Standard_B2ms** is a good combination of price and a large enough host (2cpun 8gb mem) to run kubernetes.
- **public-ip-sku** assigns a public IP address so we can access our machine remotely.
- The **-o**, **- - query**, **> myip** components get the public IP address from the output and save it to the _myip_ file.

Once the script presents you with additional options, it's safe to press < enter > and quit. You can run the helper script anytime to show these options.

Copy the **myip** file into your host to reference later.

> Type `yes` (if asked) to store the key fingerprint.  
> Enter the password of your new vm when needed.

```bash
scp myip azureuser@$(cat myip):/home/azureuser/myip
```

## :checkered_flag: Checkpoint

You can run the helper script at any time with:

```bash
~/clouddrive/helper.ps1
```

Once it loads, you'll see options to quickly login to your Azure VM or reset the password. It also shows you the exact command it runs to perform those steps if you want to experiement with it yourself.

The command to connect to your new vm is similar to below. Login and confirm you can access your vm.

```bash
ssh azureuser@[your public ip]
```

If you successfully login, congratulations! You've configured your host.
