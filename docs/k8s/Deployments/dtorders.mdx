This deployment will create an application in the **dtorders** namespace and automatically generate synthetic traffic for you.

The application consists of:

- a simple frontend UI
- a catalog service
- a customer table
- an orders table

There are also two other pods:

- a browser traffic generator creating "real" user sessions
- a load traffic generator creating hits to API's in the application

:::info Prerequisites

1. Login to your host.
2. Confirm you've recorded your public IP address with:

```bash
cat myip
```

if you don't see your IP address, return to the previous Host Setup page and retry the step to create/copy it.

:::

## Quickstart

Download the dtorders application manifest.

```bash
curl https://suchcodewow.io/manifests/dtorders/dtorders-all.yaml -L -o dtorders-all.yaml
```

Replace `dev.local` in this yaml file with your public IP address.

```bash
sed "s/dev.local/$(cat myip)/g" dtorders-all.yaml > dtorders-all-hasIP.yaml
```

Apply the updated yaml file.

```bash
kubectl apply -f dtorders-all-hasIP.yaml
```

You can see the pods that make up the application with:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n dtorders
```

The deployment uses the IP address you provided to create URL's to the various components of your application. You can see the links with:

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n dtorders
```

The **HOSTS** column shows the URL's of your services. You can copy and paste any of them into your browser.

The various components:

- **frontend** shows the main UI of the application.
- **customer** is the API for the customer list. Add `/customer` to the end of the URL to retrieve the current customers.
- **catalog** is the API for the various items for sale. Add `/catalog` to the end of the URL to see the current items.
- **order** lists the orders that have been submitted from the front end. You can manually add orders here as well.

:::info What is nip.io?
Real applications have names like 'booksforyou.com' and configure several networking components to route users to many different hosts to serve requests. It adds cost and complexity well beyond the scope of these tutorials.

For this tutorial series, we're using nip.io to elegantly provides the same functionality without cost. Anything before **.nip.io** is sent to the IP address. This means we can access any number of services on our single kubernetes cluster. Without nip.io, we'd be limited to hosting a single web service on our cluster's IP address.

For example, **dtorders-frontend.192.168.1.100.nip.io** and **dtorders-customer.192.168.1.100.nip.io** both go to **192.168.100** but nginx sees the entire URL coming in and can route the request to the appropriate service.

## :checkered_flag: Checkpoint

Find the URL for the application frontend above. Copy and paste the URL into your browser. You should see an application page similar to below.

![dtorders frontend](/img/dtorders-frontend.png)

If you see this page congratulations :tada: ! You've deployed the dtorders application. In Dynatrace, you'll see traffic begin to flow across services and at the application level.
