# DT-Orders

This deployment will create an application for you in the **dtorders** namespace and automatically generate synthetic traffic for you.

## Quickstart

Download the dtorders application manifest.

```bash
curl https://suchcodewow.io/manifests/dtorders/dtorders-all.yaml -L -o dtorders-all.yaml
```

Replace `dev.local` in this yaml file with your public IP address.

```bash
sed "s/dev.local/$(cat myip)/g" dtorders-all.yaml > dtorders-all-hasIP.yaml
```

Apply the updated yaml file.

```bash
kubectl apply -f dtorders-all-hasIP.yaml
```

You can see the pods that make up the application with:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n dtorders
```

The deployment uses the IP address you provided to create URL's to the various components of your application. You can see the links with:

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n dtorders
```

The **HOSTS** column shows the URL's of your services. You can copy and paste these in your browser to directly access the various components.

The various components:

- **frontend** shows the main UI of the application.
- **customer** is the API for the customer list. Add `/customer` to the end of the URL to retrieve the current customers.
- **catalog** is the API for the various items for sale. Add `/catalog` to the end of the URL to see the current items.
- **order** lists the orders that have been submitted from the front end. You can manually add orders here as well.

:::info What is nip.io?
Real applications have names like 'booksforyou.com' and configure several networking components to route users to many different hosts to serve requests. It adds cost and complexity that aren't necessary when starting to deploy kubernetes.  
For this tutorial series, we're using nip.io to give us similar functionality. It's a great tool that sends anything before **.nip.io** over to the given IP address. This means we can host any number of services on a single IP address.  
For example, dtorders-frontend.192.168.1.100.nip.io will send **dtorders-frontend.192.168.1.100** to IP address _192.168.100_. With zero configuration, our request reaches the IP address while simultaneously telling nginx to send us to the **dtorders-frontend** service.

Find the URL for the application frontend above. Copy and paste the URL into your browser. You should see an application page similar to below.

![dtorders frontend](/img/dtorders-frontend.png)

If you see this page congratulations :tada: ! You've deployed the dtorders application. In Dynatrace, you'll see traffic begin to flow across services and at the application level.
