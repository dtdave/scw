# DT-Orders

This deployment will create an application for you in the **dtorders** namespace and automatically generate synthetic traffic for you.

## Quickstart

Download the dtorders application manifest.

```bash
curl https://suchcodewow.io/manifests/dtorders/dtorders-all.yaml -L -o dtorders-all.yaml
```

Replace `dev.local` in this yaml file with your public IP address.

```bash
sed "s/dev.local/$(cat myip)/g" dtorders-all.yaml > dtorders-all-hasIP.yaml
```

Apply the updated yaml file.

```bash
kubectl apply -f dtorders-all.yaml
```

You can see the pods that make up the application with:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n dtorders
```

The deployment uses the IP address you provided to create URL's to the various components of your application. You can see the links with:

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n dtorders
```

The **HOSTS** column shows the URL's of your services. You can copy and paste these in your browser to directly access the various components.

The various components:

- **frontend** shows the main UI of the application.
- **customer** is the API for the customer list. Add `/customer` to the end of the URL to retrieve the current customers.
- **catalog** is the API for the various items for sale. Add `/catalog` to the end of the URL to see the current items.
- **order** lists the orders that have been submitted from the front end. You can manually add orders here as well.
