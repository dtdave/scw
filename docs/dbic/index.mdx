## Deployment assistant

The application can be easily deployed into a kubernetes environment with Pepper. While not as brilliant as the famous [Pepper Potts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_Potts), this installer:

- works seamlessly across Azure, AWS, and GCP
- creates a kubernetes cluster using best practices for each cloud
- guides you through full deployment or lets you take over at any point
- shows each command as it runs so you can repeat any step yourself later
- can be expanded with any number of kubernetes deployment (yaml) files

### Assistant download

Download

```bash
curl https://www.suchcodewow.io/manifests/pepper.ps1 > ~/pepper.ps1
```

Run

```bash
pwsh ~/pepper.ps1
```

### About the assistant

The assistant is written in powershell. The main reasons for this are:

- It is well supported natively on all 3 cloud platforms & kept up to date.
- Versus bash, the other built in option, it offers real arraylist support and native json parsing.

It is purposefully written as a single script to allow a quick download via curl instead of cloning a repo. However, the file is fully commented and if using vscode, there are instructions at the top for folding the various functions into neat one-liners making the file simple to navigate.

You can run this assistant either in the cloud shell or a local terminal with the cli tools available for your cloud vendor. Please check out the cloud vendor specific notes below if relevant.

### Assistant configuration

By default, Pepper will look for valid install locations across each cloud environment & provide feedback on steps run.

At the top of the script, there are several output levels you can modify:

```bash
$outputLevel = 1 # [0/1/2] message level to send to screen
$showCommands = $true # [$true/$false] show cloud commands as they execute
$retainLog = $false # [$true/false] keep written log between executions
```

If you are using the assistant on a local terminal and are currently logged into multiple cloud vendors, you can set specifics vendors to false to skip them:

```bash
$useAWS = $true # [$true/false] use AWS
$useAzure = $true # [$true/$false] use Azure
$useGCP = $true # [$true/$false] use GCP
```

#### GCP Specific notes

You might need to run `gcloud components update` if you run into script issues.
You might need to authorize google cloud services via popup.
