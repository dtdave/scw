# Dynatrace - Datadog Deployment comparison

## Intro

Organizations that understand the value of great Observability have a critical advantage in persuring perfect software that their customers demand.

Finding the right Observability platform that has root cause solutions ready before users even problems is paramount. But the Observability platform has to deploy effortlessly and scale elegantly- or you immediately trade troubleshooting for endless deployments, configuration, and maintenance.

But by definition when evaluating various Observability solutions, having an application to observe is equally important.  
Ideally, that evaluation takes place on your largest, most critical application(s). But there are many reasons you can't do that immediately. Evaluating Observability with a demo application can be a key step.

To help, many Observaibility providers offer freely available demo applications to showcase their solutions. Both Dynatrace and Datadog offer applications that accomplish this. And coincidentally... built with very similar technologies and ideas.
Whether the Observability solution provides amazing proactive answers can be a subjective topic. But it should be extremely clear in the comparison below which solution is the clear choice for delivering sustainable Observability at scale.

### Initial Deployment Comparison

Quick comparison below on Dynatrace **Dynabank** and Datadog **StoreDog**.

![Comparison Overview](/img/compare1.png)

Both applications are actively used today to showcase their best offerings for Observability.

Both have an agent-based deployment model.

### Overall Application Changes Comparison

But what about configuration beyond the agent to achieve great visibility?

To compare apples-to-apples, **both demo applications have a Docker Compose deployment option**. This is essentially a blueprint with all original application components combined with all necessary changes for Observability.

Below is a comparison (direct from public repos) of each Docker Compose file.

For readability, any lines related to the application itself are removed. This leaves only things that need to be figured out, discussed with app teams, and added.

Both applications showcase how quickly they can achieve Observability and how many changes you'll need to do in order to get it. Every line item in black above is another service potentially written by different teams using different deployment methods.

### Individual Services Comparison

To have a good shot at achieving Observability, the services making up your application ecosystem need instrumentation. This instrumentation gives you critical insights into end-to-end transactions of your customers/users & is paramount in having the chance to proactively find root cause.

While both Datadog and Dynabank have very similar overlapping technologies. Dynabank has 8 unique technologies while StoreDog has 5.

Below is a comparison of all files that require updates for either application. As before, these files contain configuration and code for both the application and the Observability platform.

For readability, all application specific configuration or code lines have been removed. Comments and some function brackets remain for reference.

It's important to highlight that every change means two key things:

- Initial implementation will take much longer. The math to calculate work hours is staggering: coordinate change with service developer X # of teams required to coordinate services changes X # of services in application X # of applications to monitor.
- More changes means more time spent maintaining Observability instead of using it. And if the math above wasn't already overwhelming, it becomes lethal when multiplying it again with updates every time an Observability change is needed.
