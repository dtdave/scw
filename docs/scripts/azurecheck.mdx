# Azure API Tester

## Purpose

The script below provides better visibility for troubleshooting Azure connections with a simple script outside of the Dynatrace UI.

## Usage

Download the script below, paste in your details, and run.

Possible outcomes:

- Failed to Authenticate: There is something wrong with the credentials and the error should provide more detail.
- Credentials Authenticated, but FAILED to retrieve subscriptions: The account successfully authenticated, but doesn't have permissions to any subscriptions
- Successfully Connected and retrieved subscriptions: Credentials worked and retrieved at least 1 subscription. These account details should work in Dynatrace!

## Download

[Direct Download](/manifests/azurecheck.ps1)

## Modify

Update the values within the script for your tenant:

```powershell
$tenantId = "YOUR_TENANT_ID"
$applicationId = "YOUR_APP_ID"
$secret = "SECRET_VALUE"
```

If connecting to an Azure Gov tenant, update `$isAzureGov = $false` to:

```powershell
$isAzureGov = $true
```

## Run the script

Execute the script and wait for results.
