# Kubernetes

## Overview

This tutorial series was designed to give you a good kubernetes platform built from scratch while demonstrating key concepts.

The tutorial is modular. Work from step 1 through step 4 making 1 choice in each category depending on your needs.

:clock10: All 4 steps of this tutorial could be completed in as little as 30m. On average, it will take 60-120m to setup a host and check out the key kubernetes concepts.

After completing step 4 you can check out the deployments available and add any that meet your needs.

### Step 1: Setup a Host

You can choose from different methods to setup a host. The options range from using resources on a computer you already have, through setting up a host or using a virtual machine in any of the major cloud providers.

### Step 2: Deploy Kubernetes on your host

Different kubernetes distributions offer different advantages. The options range from small footprint running only critical functions to fully featured larger installations.

### Step 3: Deploy Dynatrace

Any of the kubernetes platforms shown can be monitored by Dynatrace to provide unrivaled observability and A.I. driven insights. If you don't have Dynatrace now, consider setting up your own free trial in just a few minutes at https://www.dynatrace.com/trial.

### Step 4: First Application

With the platform running, deploy a simple web service to confirm that everything works.

### Add Deployments

With your finished kubernetes platform, check out the projects you can deploy and share with team members.
