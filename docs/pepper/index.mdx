## The cloud agnostic kubernetes assistant

Pepper is designed to help you quickly deploy kubernetes from scratch and add real-world sample applications- no matter which cloud you want to use.

Most importantly, Pepper is built from the ground up to show every step along with the exact command it runs on your behalf.

You'll get a useful kubernetes installation very quickly while seeing how to do it yourself.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the ability to use the cloud shell of your chosen cloud provider or be able to connect with a local terminal.

#### AWS

- You'll need access to an AWS region where you are able to create an EKS clusters.
- If using your terminal to connect you'll need an IAM token and secret.

#### Azure

- You will need to be able to create a resource group and an AKS cluster.

#### GCLOUD

- You will need access to an account with an existing project.
- You'll need the ability to create a GKE cluster within that project.

### Assistant download

Download:

```bash
curl https://www.suchcodewow.io/manifests/pepper.ps1 > ~/pepper.ps1
```

Run:

```bash
pwsh ~/pepper.ps1 -c
```

Supported options:

- `-c` Show cloud commands as they run within `[ ]`. Command history logged to **pepper.ps1.log** file for reference.
- `-v` Show trivial/verbose commands in pepper. Chatty, but good feedback when modifying Pepper.
- `-h` Shows all options.

### About the assistant

The assistant is written in powershell. The main reasons for this are:

- It is well supported natively on all 3 cloud platforms & kept up to date.
- Versus bash, the other built in option, it offers real arraylist support and native json parsing.

It is purposefully written as a single script to allow a quick download vs cloning a repo. However, the file is fully commented and if using vscode, there are instructions at the top for folding the various functions into neat one-liners making the file simple to navigate.

You can run this assistant either in the cloud shell or a local terminal with the cli tools available for your cloud vendor. Please check out the cloud vendor specific notes below if relevant.
