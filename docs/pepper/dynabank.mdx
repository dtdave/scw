# Hands On: Dynabank

## Deploy Dynabank

1. In tab #1 University Terminal, make sure Pepper is running and select the option to `Download demo apps yaml files`.
   This will pull the yaml blueprints for Dynabank (dbic) and any other demo apps packaged for deployment.

1. Select the option to `Deploy: dbic`. Use the `refresh pods` option over a few minutes until you have all pods deployed.

At this point, Pepper should provide the URL to your environment. Where available, you'll also get a more 'friendly' link.
